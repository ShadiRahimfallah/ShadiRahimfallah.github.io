## Teaching Assistant (2022 – Present)
As a Teaching Assistant, I supported undergraduate courses with class sizes of over 200 students. My responsibilities included holding regular office hours to provide one-on-one help, answering student questions via email and in person, grading assignments, and assisting with course logistics. I facilitated student learning by clarifying difficult concepts and guiding discussions, contributing to a positive and engaging educational environment.
