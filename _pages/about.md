I am a PhD student in the Department of Economics at York University.  
My research focuses on Macroeconomics, Financial Economics, and Development.  

Specifically, I study the role of second-hand capital under financial frictions in developing countries.  
I also have over five years of experience in energy economics research, particularly in the oil, gas, and petrochemical industries, combined with an interest in environmental and sustainability issues.
