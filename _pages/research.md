## Research Statement
I study how secondary markets for capital (used machinery and equipment) ease financial frictions in developing economies. My work combines firm-level data with quantitative general equilibrium models to assess how access to lower-priced used capital reshapes firm scale, reallocates resources toward more productive producers, and raises aggregate productivity.

### Working Paper
**Used Capital, Financial Frictions, and Misallocation (Vietnam, 2005–2015)**  
I develop a heterogeneous-firm GE model in which firms rent new or used capital under collateral constraints; rental prices are determined in equilibrium. Using Vietnamese manufacturing panel data (2005–2015), I show that access to used capital allows constrained firms to operate closer to optimal scale, improving allocative efficiency and raising aggregate TFP.

*Published August 2022*  
This paper examines the impact of oil prices and shale gas developments on polyethylene costs, employing time-series methods to quantify pass-through effects and their timing.
