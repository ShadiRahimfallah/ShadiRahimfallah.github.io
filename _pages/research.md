## Research Statement
My research investigates how used capital mitigates financial frictions in developing economies, enhancing capital allocation, firm growth, and aggregate productivity.

## Working Paper
**Used Capital, Financial Frictions, and Misallocation (Vietnam, 2005–2015)**  
I build a quantitative general equilibrium model with heterogeneous firms that rent capital subject to collateral constraints. Firms choose between new and used capital; rental prices are determined endogenously in equilibrium. Using firm-level panel data from Vietnamese manufacturing (2005–2015), I show that access to lower-priced used capital lets constrained firms operate closer to optimal scale, reallocating capital toward more productive firms and improving aggregate efficiency.
