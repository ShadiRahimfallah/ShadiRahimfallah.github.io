## Research Statement
I study how secondary markets for capital (used machinery and equipment) ease financial frictions in developing economies. My work combines firm-level data with quantitative general equilibrium models to assess how access to lower-priced used capital reshapes firm scale, reallocates resources toward more productive producers, and raises aggregate productivity.

## Papers

### Working Paper
**Used Capital, Financial Frictions, and Misallocation (Vietnam, 2005–2015)**  
I develop a heterogeneous-firm GE model where firms rent new or used capital under collateral constraints and prices are set in equilibrium. Using Vietnamese manufacturing panel data (2005–2015), I show that access to used capital helps constrained firms operate closer to optimal scale, improving allocative efficiency and raising aggregate TFP.

## Research in Progress

**Collateral Constraints and Rental-Market Depth (in progress)**  
Explores how credit frictions interact with the depth of used-capital markets. In the model, tightening collateral constraints raises demand for used capital, altering rental rates and firm scale; shallow rental markets can amplify misallocation in downturns.

**Energy-Price Shocks and Investment Reallocation: Evidence from Iran (in progress)**  
Examines how oil and gas price volatility reshapes sectoral investment in Iran. Combines sector-level data with macro indicators, using SVAR, local projections, and panel methods to trace dynamic adjustment paths and long-run growth implications.

**Cultural and ESG Predictors of Human Development: A Machine-Learning Approach (in progress)**  
Builds a predictive framework linking Hofstede cultural dimensions and sovereign ESG metrics to cross-country human development. Uses gradient boosting, penalized regression, and clustering to capture nonlinear interactions in high-dimensional data.

## Additional Projects

**Macroeconomic Indexes and Petrochemical Sector Performance (University of Tehran)**  
Brief: A Panel VAR shows deposit-rate shocks lower stock returns; real-exchange-rate and market-return shocks raise them; oil-price shocks depress returns but fade gradually.  
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
In this study, I apply a PVAR to examine how oil prices, real exchange rates, deposit rates, and market returns shape stock returns in Iran’s petrochemical sector. Impulse–response functions show deposit-rate shocks reduce returns, exchange-rate shocks increase them, and oil shocks have a negative yet diminishing effect across quarters—highlighting persistent macro-financial channels shaping firm performance.

**Master’s Thesis (Energy Economics)** — *The Effect of Shale Gas Expansion on the Attractiveness of Iran’s Petrochemical Industry*  
Brief: Global shale gas lowered feedstock costs abroad, intensifying competition and challenging Iran’s export position; domestic exchange-rate and inflation dynamics are also pivotal.  
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
The thesis studies how the U.S. shale-gas boom reshaped global petrochemical competitiveness. Using time-series and panel econometrics (e.g., VECM/cointegration), it links shale-driven energy price changes with polyethylene prices and sectoral performance, showing how external energy shocks and domestic macro factors jointly determine industry attractiveness.

**Shale-Gas Revolution and Polyethylene Prices (University of Tehran)**  
Brief: Time-series models trace pass-through from shale-driven gas price declines to lower polyethylene prices, revealing strong energy-to-industry transmission.  
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
Econometric analysis shows cheaper gas inputs increased supply and put durable downward pressure on polymer prices, illustrating how energy shocks propagate through manufacturing cost structures and global competition.

**Gas Pricing Mechanisms (University of Tehran)**  
Brief: Policy framework for efficient and equitable natural-gas pricing under natural-monopoly conditions, estimated with GMM to handle endogeneity and dynamics.  
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
Grounded in public-sector pricing and Ramsey principles, the project estimates demand and cost relationships and evaluates alternative pricing rules under subsidy reform. GMM estimation provides consistent dynamics, yielding benchmarks that balance fiscal goals, consumer welfare, and industrial competitiveness.
