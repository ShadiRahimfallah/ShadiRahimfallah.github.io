## Research Statement
My research focuses on the interaction between **financial frictions, used capital, and misallocation**. I study how the availability of second-hand capital provides firms with a lower-cost financing option that relaxes collateral constraints, reshapes investment scale, and reduces productivity losses from misallocation. Using firm-level data from Vietnamese manufacturing and quantitative general equilibrium models, my research shows that incorporating second-hand capital significantly improves resource allocation in economies with underdeveloped financial systems.

## Working Paper
**Entry, Exit, and Capital Choice: How Collateral Constraints Shape Firm Dynamics (JMP)**  

Brief: The entry/exit model with a new-vs-used Capital margin shows that tighter collateral limits and higher entry costs push entrants toward used equipment, compress startup scale, raise early exit, and reduce TFP.
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
I develop a heterogeneous-firm model with entry, exit, and an explicit choice between new and used capital Two frictions—collateral limits and entry costs—govern market access, startup scale, vintage at birth, leverage, and survival. The used stock evolves realistically: each period, some new capital transitions into the used pool, and some used equipment retires. I solve and simulate the model in MATLAB (collocation plus large-panel simulations) and build calibration targets in Stata from Vietnam’s 2005–2015 manufacturing data, including the used-investment share, debt-to-GDP, output volatility, and short- to medium-run persistence. The framework quantifies how tighter finance and higher entry fees push marginal entrants toward cheaper used capital and smaller initial scale, increasing early-life exit and lowering TFP through composition and scale distortions.

**Heterogeneous Firms, Collateral Constraints, and Used Capital: A General Equilibrium Analysis of Capital Misallocation**

Brief: A general equilibrium model shows that access to used capital reduces misallocation by relaxing collateral constraints, improving capital allocation, and productivity. Firm-level evidence confirms that financially constrained firms make greater use of used capital.
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
This study examines how used capital helps reduce the productivity losses created by financial frictions in developing economies. Drawing on Vietnamese manufacturing data, it develops a general equilibrium model in which heterogeneous firms rent both new and used capital while facing collateral constraints. Because used capital is cheaper to rent and requires less collateral, constrained firms can operate closer to their efficient scale, which improves aggregate efficiency. The model shows that when used capital is available, misallocation losses are markedly lower than in an economy restricted to new capital. Firm-level evidence further confirms that financially constrained firms rely more heavily on used capital, in line with the theoretical predictions. Together, these findings suggest that secondary markets for used capital serve as a key channel for relaxing borrowing constraints and enhancing resource allocation in economies with underdeveloped financial systems.

**Shadow Cost of Funds, Collateral Constraints, and Used Capital: A Model of Capital Misallocation**

Brief: Firms can choose new vs. used capital. The lower purchase price of used capital relaxes financing for constrained firms, letting them scale earlier with more self-financing, improve short-run survival, and reduce the mass of chronically small firms. This shifts the vintage mix and aggregate misallocation.
<details><summary>Read more</summary> 
  This paper builds a firm-dynamics model without an entry margin. Firms face a collateral-style affordability cap and a shadow cost of funds that captures financing tightness. The key feature is a vintage choice between new and used capital, treated as two distinct goods: a unit bought as new remains new, and a unit bought as used remains used. There is no conversion from new to used and no additional within-type quality downgrading beyond standard (type-specific) depreciation.
Mechanism: Because used capital has a lower upfront price, constrained firms can expand capacity sooner with less external finance, while self-financing builds assets. Large, unconstrained firms change their vintage mix little.
Implementation uses MATLAB to solve and simulate the model and Stata to construct 2005–2015 targets from Vietnam manufacturing (used-investment share, debt-to-GDP, output volatility, and persistence).

## Additional Projects
**Cultural and ESG Predictors of Human Development: A Machine-Learning Approach**(Research in Progress)
Brief: This project uses machine-learning methods to link ESG indicators and cultural values with the Human Development Index (HDI), highlighting how institutions and sustainability shape long-run welfare.  
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
This project integrates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) indicators with Hofstede’s cultural dimensions to build a predictive model of the Human Development Index (HDI). Using techniques such as gradient boosting, penalized regression, and unsupervised clustering, the framework identifies nonlinear interactions and latent groupings in high-dimensional data. The research highlights how cultural values, governance quality, and sustainability practices jointly shape human development outcomes. It not only improves forecasting accuracy relative to traditional models but also uncovers policy-relevant pathways, showing, for example, how combinations of governance strength and cultural orientation condition the returns to social investment. By merging cross-country datasets with advanced machine learning, the project advances the measurement of development and provides a richer understanding of the institutional and cultural drivers of long-run welfare.

**Macroeconomic Indexes and Petrochemical Sector Performance**  
Brief: This panel VAR study shows that higher deposit rates lower petrochemical stock returns, while exchange-rate and overall market gains raise them. Oil-price increases hurt returns at first, but the effect fades gradually.  
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
In this study, I apply a panel VAR to examine how oil prices, real exchange rates, deposit rates, and market returns shape stock returns in Iran’s petrochemical sector. Impulse–response functions show deposit-rate shocks reduce returns, exchange-rate shocks increase them, and oil shocks have a negative yet diminishing effect across quarters—highlighting persistent macro-financial channels shaping firm performance.

**Master’s Thesis (Energy Economics)** — **The Effect of Shale Gas Expansion on the Attractiveness of Iran’s Petrochemical Industry**  
Brief: Global shale gas lowered feedstock costs abroad, intensifying competition and challenging Iran’s export position; domestic exchange-rate and inflation dynamics are also pivotal.  
<details><summary>Read more</summary>
The thesis studies how the U.S. shale-gas boom reshaped global petrochemical competitiveness. Using time-series and panel econometrics (e.g., VECM/cointegration), it links shale-driven energy price changes with polyethylene prices and sectoral performance, showing how external energy shocks and domestic macro factors jointly determine industry attractiveness.

Econometric analysis shows that cheaper gas inputs increased supply and put durable downward pressure on polymer prices, illustrating how energy shocks propagate through manufacturing cost structures and global competition.

Grounded in public-sector pricing and Ramsey principles, the project estimates demand and cost relationships and evaluates alternative pricing rules under subsidy reform. GMM estimation provides consistent dynamics, yielding benchmarks that balance fiscal goals, consumer welfare, and industrial competitiveness.

**Health Financing and Inequality in Iran**  
Brief: Using province-by-year data, places with higher average household income have fewer infant and overall deaths, while more income inequality is linked to more deaths. Insurance coverage, education, and health-care capacity also help reduce deaths.
<details><summary>Read more</summary> I compare each province to itself over time (so fixed local traits don’t bias results) and track two outcomes: infant mortality and all-cause mortality. The main drivers are log household spending (a proxy for income), the Gini index (a measure of inequality), education, insurance coverage, and healthcare capacity. To check the direction of cause and effect, I also repeat the analysis using past values as instruments. The pattern is robust: higher income → lower mortality; higher inequality → higher mortality; more insurance, education, and care capacity → lower mortality.
