## Working Papers
 **Entry, Exit, and Capital Choice: How Collateral Constraints Shape Firm Dynamics (JMP)**  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   I develop a heterogeneous-firm model with entry, exit, and an explicit choice between new and used capital. Tighter collateral limits and higher entry costs push entrants toward used equipment, compress startup scale, raise early exit, and reduce TFP. Calibration to Vietnamese manufacturing data (2005–2015) quantifies these distortions.

 Heterogeneous Firms, Collateral Constraints, and Used Capital: A General Equilibrium Analysis of Capital Misallocation  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   A general equilibrium model shows that access to used capital reduces misallocation by relaxing collateral constraints, improving capital allocation, and raising productivity. Firm-level evidence confirms that financially constrained firms make greater use of used capital.

 Shadow Cost of Funds, Collateral Constraints, and Used Capital: A Model of Capital Misallocation
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   Firms can choose between new and used capital. The lower purchase price of used capital allows constrained firms to expand earlier with more self-financing, improves short-run survival, and reduces the prevalence of chronically small firms. This shifts the vintage mix and mitigates aggregate misallocation.

## Additional Projects
 Cultural and ESG Predictors of Human Development: A Machine-Learning Approach (Research in Progress)  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   This project uses machine-learning methods to link ESG indicators and cultural values with the Human Development Index (HDI), highlighting how institutions and sustainability shape long-run welfare.
   </details>


 Macroeconomic Indexes and Petrochemical Sector Performance  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   This panel VAR study shows that higher deposit rates lower petrochemical stock returns, while exchange-rate and overall market gains raise them. Oil-price increases hurt returns at first, but the effect fades gradually.
   </details>


 Master’s Thesis (Energy Economics): The Effect of Shale Gas Expansion on the Attractiveness of Iran’s Petrochemical Industry  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   Global shale gas lowered feedstock costs abroad, intensifying competition and challenging Iran’s export position; domestic exchange-rate and inflation dynamics are also pivotal.
   </details>


 Shale-Gas Revolution and Polyethylene Prices 
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   Time-series models trace pass-through from shale-driven gas price declines to lower polyethylene prices, revealing strong energy-to-industry transmission.
   </details>


 Gas Pricing Mechanisms  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   Policy framework for efficient and equitable natural-gas pricing under natural-monopoly conditions, estimated with GMM to handle endogeneity and dynamics.
   </details>


 Health Financing and Inequality in Iran  
   <details><summary>Abstract</summary>
   Using province-by-year data, places with higher household income have fewer infant and overall deaths, while more inequality is linked to more deaths. Insurance coverage, education, and health-care capacity also reduce mortality.
