## Professional Experience

### Health Economics & Data Analyst

I worked on applied research projects in health economics and inequality, combining rigorous quantitative analysis with policy-relevant evaluation. My responsibilities included designing cost-effectiveness studies, managing and analyzing large datasets, and applying econometric methods to measure efficiency and distributional outcomes in healthcare.  

The role required close collaboration with multidisciplinary teams and the communication of complex findings to both technical and non-technical audiences. This experience deepened my interest in inequality and resource allocation while strengthening my ability to connect analytical methods with real-world challenges.
