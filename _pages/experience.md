## Professional Experience

### Economics Research Analyst

I worked on applied research projects with a focus on data-driven analysis of inequality and resource allocation. My responsibilities included designing empirical studies, managing and analyzing large datasets, and applying econometric and statistical techniques to evaluate efficiency and distributional outcomes.

The role required close collaboration with multidisciplinary teams and clear communication of complex results to both technical and non-technical audiences. This experience strengthened my expertise in big data analytics, econometric modeling, and quantitative research, while deepening my ability to connect analytical methods with real-world challenges in both industry and research contexts.
