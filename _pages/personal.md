## Outside Academia
Outside of research and teaching, I value activities that give me balance and perspective. I enjoy spending time outdoors—hiking, camping, and paddle-boarding. Cooking is another passion: experimenting with new recipes and sharing meals with friends is one of my favorite ways to connect across cultures.  

Reading is also an important part of my life. I read broadly beyond economics—literature, history, psychology, and science—which helps me stay curious and often inspires fresh perspectives for my work.

## Reflections
This page is a space where I share ideas and recommendations that go beyond my academic work. Whether it’s a book that shaped my perspective, a lesson from time outdoors, or a reflection on teaching and learning, my aim is to stay curious, kind, and open to new ways of thinking.
