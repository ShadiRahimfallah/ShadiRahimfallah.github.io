Welcome!
I am a PhD student in Economics at York University. My research explores how secondary markets for capital—particularly used machinery and equipment—help ease financial frictions in developing economies. By studying firm-level data and building quantitative general equilibrium models, I examine how access to lower-cost used capital improves resource allocation, supports firm growth, and raises aggregate productivity.
