Hello! Welcome to my website.

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at York University. My research examines how financial frictions and access to second-hand capital shape development outcomes in emerging economies. By combining firm-level data with quantitative general equilibrium models, I study how the availability of lower-cost used machinery and equipment relaxes collateral constraints, improves resource allocation, supports firm growth, and raises aggregate productivity.
