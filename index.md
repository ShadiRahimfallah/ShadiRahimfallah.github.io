Welcome!

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at York University. My research examines how secondary markets for capital—particularly used machinery and equipment—can help ease financial frictions in developing economies. By combining firm-level data with quantitative general equilibrium models, I study how access to lower-cost used capital improves resource allocation, supports firm growth, and raises aggregate productivity.
